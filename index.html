        <div class="howto-container">
            Our project combines an engaging, gamified experience with comprehensive information about each 
            engineering major. Unlike traditional academic advising and online tools, our platform offers interactive mini-games, 
            student testimonials, and detailed insights into each major, making it easier for students to make informed decisions about 
            their academic and career paths.
