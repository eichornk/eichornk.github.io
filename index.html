            <p> We've taken information from students in the College of Engineering at Oregon State University and turn it into a quiz
                to help you find your top three engineering majors and explore the majors from a student perspective.

                    Advisors are tasked with advising students on their academic path and major selection is a crucial part of that path. 
                    They want to effectively guide students but find it difficult with the limited tools they’re provided and the fact 
                    that many students still aren’t aware of what their goals are in college.

                    College students face the challenge of choosing the right major that best aligns with their interests, skills, and 
                    career aspirations. Many feel overwhelmed with the choices and under-informed about the implications of each path, 
                    leading to anxiety and uncertainty about their future.

                    Engineering students lack the resource of getting to know information about every engineering degree. Going through each
                    major on the website takes too much time and you don’t get a student perspective of the classes, professors, internship
                    opportunities, and more. These students or “users” want a more usable option to explore different majors in the College of Engineering.

                Our project combines an engaging, gamified experience with comprehensive information about each 
                engineering major. Unlike traditional academic advising and online tools, our platform offers interactive mini-games, 
                student testimonials, and detailed insights into each major, making it easier for students to make informed decisions about 
                their academic and career paths.
